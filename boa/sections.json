[["# NumPy Operations", "NumPy Operations"], ["## Arithmetic", "Arithmetic\n\nYou can easily perform array with array arithmetic, or scalar with array arithmetic. Let's see some examples:\nimport numpy as np\narr = np.arange(0,10)\narr + arr\narr * arr\narr - arr\n# Warning on division by zero, but not an error!\n# Just replaced with nan\narr/arr\n# Also warning, but not an error instead infinity\n1/arr\narr**3"], ["## Universal Array Functions", "Universal Array Functions\n\nNumpy comes with many [universal array functions](http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/ufuncs.html), which are essentially just mathematical operations you can use to perform the operation across the array.
