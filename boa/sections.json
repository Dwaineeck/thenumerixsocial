[["# NumPy Exercises", "NumPy Exercises\n\nNow that we've learned about NumPy let's test your knowledge. We'll start off with a few simple tasks, and then you'll be asked some more complicated questions.\n#### Import NumPy as np\n\n#### Create an array of 10 zeros \n\n#### Create an array of 10 ones\n\n#### Create an array of 10 fives\n\n#### Create an array of the integers from 10 to 50\n\n#### Create an array of all the even integers from 10 to 50\n\n#### Create a 3x3 matrix with values ranging from 0 to 8\n\n#### Create a 3x3 identity matrix\n\n#### Use NumPy to generate a random number between 0 and 1\n\n#### Use NumPy to generate an array of 25 random numbers sampled from a standard normal distribution\n\n#### Create the following matrix:\n\n#### Create an array of 20 linearly spaced points between 0 and 1:\n"], ["## Numpy Indexing and Selection", "Numpy Indexing and Selection\n\nNow you will be given a few matrices, and be asked to replicate the resulting matrix outputs:\nmat = np.arange(1,26).reshape(5,5)\nmat\n# WRITE CODE HERE THAT REPRODUCES THE OUTPUT OF THE CELL BELOW\n# BE CAREFUL NOT TO RUN THE CELL BELOW, OTHERWISE YOU WON'T\n# BE ABLE TO SEE THE OUTPUT ANY MORE\n\n# WRITE CODE HERE THAT REPRODUCES THE OUTPUT OF THE CELL BELOW\n# BE CAREFUL NOT TO RUN THE CELL BELOW, OTHERWISE YOU WON'T\n# BE ABLE TO SEE THE OUTPUT ANY MORE\n\n# WRITE CODE HERE THAT REPRODUCES THE OUTPUT OF THE CELL BELOW\n# BE CAREFUL NOT TO RUN THE CELL BELOW, OTHERWISE YOU WON'T\n# BE ABLE TO SEE THE OUTPUT ANY MORE\n\n# WRITE CODE HERE THAT REPRODUCES THE OUTPUT OF THE CELL BELOW\n# BE CAREFUL NOT TO RUN THE CELL BELOW, OTHERWISE YOU WON'T\n# BE ABLE TO SEE THE OUTPUT ANY MORE\n\n# WRITE CODE HERE THAT REPRODUCES THE OUTPUT OF THE CELL BELOW\n# BE CAREFUL NOT TO RUN THE CELL BELOW, OTHERWISE YOU WON'T\n# BE ABLE TO SEE THE OUTPUT ANY MORE\n\n### Now do the following\n#### Get the sum of all the values in mat\n\n#### Get the standard deviation of the values in mat\n\n#### Get the sum of all the columns in mat\n"], ["# Great Job!", "Great Job!"]]
